# CMIS P3: Physical UI

This only example code for the how to optimize geometry.

## Ruffle code example
This code is derived from https://github.com/mad-s/ruffles-editor/, which is the implementation of the paper: 

Developable Metamaterials: Mass-fabricable Metamaterials by Laser-Cutting Elastic Structures. Madlaina Signer, Alexandra Ion, Olga Sorkine-Hornung. 2021. In Proceedings of CHI ’21. Virtual conference (formerly Yokohama, Japan). May 8 – 13, 2021. DOI: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445666


## Run the code
To run the code, follow the build instructions from [P0-setup/cpp_setup](../P0-setup/cpp_setup/). You don't need to to the install steps if you have done them already for P0. Only do the build steps described at "(2) Build using CMake".

It will create an executable for each file in the folder `source/bin`. The code in other folders are linked as a library.
