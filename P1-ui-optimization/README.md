# Requirements 
This assignment requires you to set up the [Gurobi Optimizer](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-software/) on your own device. First, create an account with Gurobi and request a Named-User Academic license. This requires you to either be on campus or connected to the University network via a VPN. Then, download Gurobi Optimizer following the instructions under "Full Installation" in the following [guide](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/4534161999889-How-do-I-install-Gurobi-Optimizer). Finally, set up Gurobi for Python by installing gurobipy package. The easiest way is to use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/gurobipy/). Depending on your device, you may have to set up Python beforehand. On Windows, it is recommended you set up your development environment using Anaconda. On Mac, I had set up a Python 3.11.11 virtual environment using pyenv. If all was managed successfully, you should be able to execute `import gurobipy` in Python.
